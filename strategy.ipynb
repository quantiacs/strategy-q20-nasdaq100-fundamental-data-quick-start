    "## Potential Issues in Working with Fundamental Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inconsistency in fact publication among companies:**\n",
    "  - One company might not publish a specific fact but might provide other data from which this fact can be derived.\n",
    "  - Another company, on the contrary, might directly provide the fact, omitting intermediary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lack of standardized formulas for indicators:**\n",
    "  - Not all indicators have standard calculation formulas.\n",
    "  - For some of them, each company decides on its own which fundamental facts should be used to form the indicator.\n",
    "  - This can lead to the same company using different data at different times for one indicator.\n",
    "  - It's not accurate to compare companies based on such indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Changing the strategy of indicator construction:**\n",
    "  - When updating financial statements, a company may change the methodology or calculation formulas for indicators, introducing an element of uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Errors and corrections in reports:**\n",
    "  - Reports can contain errors, which are corrected later, but the initial data can distort the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data omissions:**\n",
    "  - Some facts might be missing in the reports.\n",
    "  - Companies might release their reports on different dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Issues with indicators based on stock prices:**\n",
    "  - If a company conducts a stock split before publishing a report, indicators can show unexpected changes, distorting the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The current implementation of Quantiacs partially resolve these issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When constructing an indicator, one formula is used for all companies, allowing them to be compared under \"similar\" conditions.\n",
    "- If key data for calculation is missing, the algorithm tries to restore it using other facts or indicators.\n",
    "- If data from the SEC gov report is missing, the algorithm tries to restore the missing information based on annual and quarterly reports, or if absent, uses average values.\n",
    "- By default, the strategy for constructing indicators is over 12 months (LTM). Users can build indicators for the quarter (QF) or use annual values (AF).\n",
